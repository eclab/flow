# Flow Macros  

Flow macros are patches meant to be loaded as modules inside other patches.  This collection of macros may prove useful to you as modules.

* **Bass Filter**  
  Boosts the bass in a sound below a certain cutoff frequency

* **Brick Wall Filter**  
  Eliminates all partials above a certain cutoff frequency

* **CC Harmonics**  
  Controls the amplitudes of harmonics 1 ... 96 independently via CC values sent from a MIDI controller.  You can use this patch to generate sounds from scratch, or use it in combination with AmpMath (using "multiply") to modify the amplitudes of harmonics from an existing sound.

* **Random Fatten**  
  Fattens a sound but randomly changes the degree of fattening

* **Super Saw**
  A bad attempt at a super saw oscillator

* **Tamp**
  Starting at some cutoff frequency, linearly cuts down the amplitude of high harmonics until they reach 0 at around 22 KHz. 

* Waver
  Adds random noise to an existing modulation signal, perhaps to humanise it.
