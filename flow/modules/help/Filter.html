A state-variable 2- or 4-pole filter.

<dl>
<dt>Input
<dd>The partials input source.
<dt>Cutoff
<dd>The cutoff frequency.
<dt>State
<dd>The type of filter.  The filter state can range from High Pass through Notch, through Low Pass, through Band Pass, and then to High Pass again.
<dt>Resonance
<dd>The degree of resonance.
<dt>4-Pole
<dd>The filter is normally a 2-pole filter.  This changes to a 4-pole (by doing two 2-pole filters in series).
<dt>Relative
<dd>Is the cutoff frequency shifted relative to the base pitch of the note?
<dt>Taper
<dd>Should we gradually taper off the amplitude so that it reaches 0 at the Nyquist limit?  Tapering more closely approximates a digital filter; not tapering (the default) more closely approximates an analog filter.
