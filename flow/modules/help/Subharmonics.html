Outputs a set of harmonics <i>below</i> the fundamental with varying amplitudes.

<dl>
<dt>Amp 1, Amp 1/2,  ... Amp 1/32
<dd>The amplitudes of the fundamental (Amp 1) and the first 31 subharmonics.  A subharmonic 1/n is 1/n the frequency of the fundamental.
<dt>Mutate
<dd>Randomly mutates the amplitudes of all subharmonics by the given amount.
