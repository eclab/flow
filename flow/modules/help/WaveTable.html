Outputs partials from wavetable.

<p>Traditionaly a wavetable is a list of single-cycle waves, and you can modulate which wave is being outputted.  Flow doesn't have waves: instead Flow's wavetable is a list of sets of partials: the effect is the same.

<p>The Wavetable module can load the following wavetables:

<ul>
<li>Sysex files for <b>Waldorf Blofeld wavetables</b>.  These files end end in .syx or .SYX.  See the About pane for information about where to find them.

<p><li>WAV files from <b>waveeditoneline.com</b>.  These files are a concatenation of 128 waves, each of which is 256 samples.  The WAV files must be 16-bit signed integer PCM, Mono only, and end in .wav or .WAV

<p><li>WAV files representing an arbitrary raw sound sample.  he WAV files must be 16-bit signed integer PCM, Mono only, and end in .wav or .WAV
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>Position
<dd>Where in the wavetable we should select the wave to output.
<dt>Interpolate
<dd>If the position specified is in between two waves, should we output a wave that is the interpolation (average) of the two, or should we just output the wave that is nearest?
<dt>Wavetable...
<dd>Loads the wavetable either from WAV or from Blofeld sysex
<dt>Sample...
<dd>Loads a sample as if it were wavetable.  This does some additional smoothing on the sample to convert it appropriately.
