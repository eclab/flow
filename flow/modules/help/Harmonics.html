Outputs a set of harmonics with varying amplitudes.

<dl>
<dt>Amp 1 ... 32
<dd>The amplitudes of the first 32 harmonics.  Harmonic 1 is the fundamental.
<dt>Get
<dd>Loads the amplitudes from the provided source
<dt>Source
<dd>The incoming harmonics to load from
<dt>Get
<dd>Extracts the first 32 harmonics from the given source.
<dt>Compress
<dd>Rearranges the harmonics so that all non-zero-amplitude harmonics come first.
<dt>Mutate
<dd>Randomly mutates the amplitudes of all harmonics by the given amount.
