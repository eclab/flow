Various low-pass ladder filters.

<dl>
<dt>Input
<dd>The partials input source.
<dt>Cutoff
<dd>The cutoff frequency.
<dt>Resonance
<dd>The degree of resonance.  Note that a 1-pole (6dB) filter cannot resonate.
<dt>Poles
<dd>The number of poles in the filter.  

<dl>
<dt>1 (6dB)
<dd>A 1-pole, 6dB filter.  Note that this filter is not technically a ladder filter, but ladder filters are built from strings of such filters.  1-pole filters have no resonance.
<dt>3 (18dB)
<dd>A 3-pole, 18dB filter.
<dt>4 (24dB)
<dd>A 4-pole, 24dB filter.  This is the classic ladder filter confguration.
<dt>6 (36dB)
<dd>A 6-pole, 36dB filter.
<dt>8 (48dB)
<dd>An 8-pole, 48dB filter.
</dl>

<dt>Relative
<dd>Is the cutoff frequency shifted relative to the base pitch of the note?
<dt>Taper
<dd>Should we gradually taper off the amplitude so that it reaches 0 at the Nyquist limit?  Tapering more closely approximates a digital filter; not tapering (the default) more closely approximates an analog filter.
