A Decay-Attack-Delay-Sustain-Release envelope.

<dl>
<dt>Delay Time
<dd>The amount of time taken to delay before starting the attack.
<dt>Delay Level
<dd>The level reached at the end of the Delay stage.
<dt>Attack Time
<dd>Time taken during the attack stage.
<dt>Attack Level
<dd>Level reached at the end of the attack stage.
<dt>Decay Time
<dd>Time taken duing the decay stage.
<dt>Sustain Level
<dd>Level to which the envelope decays.  The envelope then holds at the sustain level until a NOTE OFF occurs or a Note-Off trigger fires.
<dt>Release Time
<dd>Time take during the release stage.
<dt>Release Level
<dd>Level to which release decays.
<dt>On Tr
<dd>Triggers the Note-On trigger.  Otherwise, a NOTE ON event performs this trigger.
<dt>Off Tr
<dd>Triggers the Note-Off trigger.  Otherwise, a NOTE OFF event performs this trigger. 
<dt>Curve
<dd>The curve taken by the attack, decay, and release.  See the manual for a description of the available curves.
<dt>One Shot
<dd>If the Note Off trigger is received, it is ignored: the envelope will attack, then decay to sustain, then immediately release on its own.
<dt>Gate Reset
<dd>When a Note On occurs, the envelope immediately resets to the Release level.  Otherwise the envelope starts from whatever level it is currently at (the default).
<dt>MIDI Sync
<dd>Delay, Attack, Decay, and Release times assume that we are playing at 120 BPM.  If MIDI sync is faster (or slower), these times will be correspondingly faster (or slower).
<dt>Fast Release
<dd>If during the Decay stage a Note Off trigger occurs, the release stage is entered immediately.  Otherwise it is entered when the Decay stage has completed (the default).
<dt>D, A, D, S, R, E
<dd>Trigger outputs which fire when the envelope reaches its Delay, Attack, Decay, Sustain, or Release stages, or Ends.
