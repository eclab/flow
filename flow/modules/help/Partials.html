Outputs a set of partials with varying frequencies and amplitudes.

<dl>
<dt>Freq 1 ... 16
<dd>The frequencies of 16 partials.
<dt>Amp 1 ... 16
<dd>The amplitudes of the same 16 partials.
<dt>Source
<dd>The incoming partials to load from
<dt>Get
<dd>Extracts the first 16 partials from the given source.
<dt>Compress
<dd>Rearranges the partials so that all non-zero-amplitude partials come first.
<dt>Mutate
<dd>Randomly mutates either the frequencies or the amplitudes of all partials by the given amount.
