If this is a top-level patch, outputs sound as audio and displays sound and signals.  If this is a macro, provides the sound and signals to the parent.

Macros can provide up to four audio outputs and four modulation signal outputs to their parents.  The default names for these are A, B, C, D and 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively.  You can change the names of these outputs by clicking on the title (the underlined portion).  Unused outputs are trimmed out when a Macro is displayed.

<dl>
<dt><font style="color:black; background-color:yellow;">&nbsp;Clip&nbsp;</font></span>
<dd>Indicates that Flow is producing sound louder than the maximum amplitude of your machine, resulting in clipping.
<dt><font style="color:white; background-color:red;">&nbsp;Glitch&nbsp;</font>
<dd>Indicates that Flow cannot run fast enough to keep the audio buffer filled, resulting in glitches as the buffer gets filled with 0.
<dt>A (Audio)
<dd>If this is a top-level patch, then this outputs the partials as audio, and also displays it in the left partials display.  If this is a macro, then this routes to partials output A in the parent.
<dt>B (Aux)
<dd>If this is a top-level patch, then this displays the partials in the right partials display.  If this is a macro, then this routes to partials output B in the parent.
<dt>C, D
<dd>If this is a macro, then these route to partials outputs C and D in the parent.
<dt>1 (Scope)
<dd>If this is a top-level patch, then this displays the modulation signal in the left oscilloscope.  If this is a macro, then this routes to modulation output 1 in the parent.
<dt>2 (Aux)
<dd>If this is a top-level patch, then this displays the modulation signal in the right oscilloscope.  If this is a macro, then this routes to modulation output 2 in the parent.
<dt>3, 4
<dd>If this is a macro, then these route to modulation signal outputs 3 and 4 in the parent.
<dt>Gain
<dd>If this is a top-level patch, then this modifies the final volume of the sound.
<dt>Wet
<dd>If this is a top-level patch, then this sets the wetness of the reverb.
<dt>Damp
<dd>If this is a top-level patch, then this sets the dampening of the reverb.
<dt>Size
<dd>If this is a top-level patch, then this sets the room size of the reverb.
<dt>Pan
<dd>If this is a top-level patch, then this sets the panning of the sound.
<dt>Dephase
<dd>If this is a top-level patch, then this sets whether the partials are in phase or randomly dephased.
<dt>Edit
<dd>Lets you set the <b>Name, Version, Author, Date,</b> and <b>Information</b> regarding the patch.
